### Python Programming Assignment: Number Exploration Tool.
**Instructions:**
 
 1.  First you say user enter your name. 
 2. Ask him give me your three favorite number.  
 3. You print a message to user call his name and beautiful message  send let`s check your three favorite number.
 4. You check the number is "even" or "odd" if number is even "you   
 say this number is even &  number is odd you say this number is odd 
 store this information in a separate list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number and a string indicating whether it is "even" or "odd".
 5.  This program should use a for loop to iterate over the list of numbers, and for each number, it should create a tuple containing the number and its square.
 6. These tuples should be printed in a creative and engaging format. Additionally, the program should calculate the sum of the three numbers and print the result, accompanied by an encouraging message.
 7.  Finally, the program should determine if the sum is a prime number and notify the user with an appropriate message.
